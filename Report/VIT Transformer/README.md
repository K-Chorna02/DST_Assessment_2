## Description
Throughout our project we focus on two data sets; the CIFAR 10 and Food 101 datasets. The smaller CIFAR-10 dataset is used as a toy data set to explore optimization, specifically focusing on the number of convolution layers and (as an extention: visualise what the output of each layer looks like. ) 

We focus our exploration on 2 pre-trained models, ResNet-18 and Transforms.
