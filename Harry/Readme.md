I have taken and optimised code designing a CNN which classifies images from the CIFAR 10 dataset.

Original code: https://medium.com/data-bistrot/a-simple-image-classifier-with-a-python-neural-network-82a5522fe48b

The files in this folder have the four gradually improved versions of the code, with annotations and explanation throughout.

Please start with CNNv1.ipynb and end with CNNv4.ipynb!
